** ONESHELL

   We emit

   #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /bin/bash
     .SHELLFLAGS = -ec
   #+END_SRC

   at the top of the Makefile.  This causes =make= to invoke the shell
   such that it executes the recipe lines of each rule as a single
   chunk instead of one shell invocation per line (or multiple
   continuation lines using "\"). Note that we have to pass -c to the
   shell so it doesn't attempt to execute the shell code chunk as a
   command.
